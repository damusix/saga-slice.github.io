The following helpers are available for use with your saga slices. When used in combination with the other helpers, it makes development of new sagas much quicker.

### `readAllSuccess(state, payload)`

-   Sets the `isFetching` state to `false`.
-   Maps the response payload into an object formatted like `{ [item.id]: item }`

```javascript
state.data = Object.values(payload || {}).reduce(
    (a, c) => ({
        ...a,
        [c.id]: c,
    }),
    {}
);
```

### `readOneSuccess(state, payload)`

-   Sets the `isFetching` state to `false`.
-   Maps response to data by id

```javascript
state.data[payload.id] = {
    ...(state.data[payload.id] || {}),
    ...payload,
};
```

### `createSuccess(state, payload)`

-   Sets the `isFetching` state to `false`
-   Maps response to data by id

```javascript
state.data[payload.id] = payload;
```

### `updateSuccess(state, payload)`

-   Sets the `isFetching` state to `false`.
-   Maps response to data by id

```javascript
state.data[payload.id] = {
    ...(state.data[payload.id] || {}),
    ...payload,
};
```

### `deleteSuccess(state, payload)`

-   Sets the `isFetching` state to `false`.
-   Deletes item from `data`

```javascript
delete state.data[payload.id];
```

### `failReducer(state, payload)`

-   Sets the `isFetching` state to `false`.

```javascript
state.isFetching = false;
state.error = payload;
```

### `loadingReducer(state, payload)`

-   Sets the `isFetching` state to `true`.

### `notLoadingReducer(state, payload)`

-   Sets the `isFetching` state to false.

### `setCurrent(state, payload)`

-   If passed a number or string, sets `state.current` to an item in `state.data`
-   If passed an object, sets `state.current` to `payload`

```javascript
if (payload.constructor === Object) {
    state.current = payload;
}

if (payload.constructor === Number || payload.constructor === String) {
    state.current = state.data[payload];
}
```

### `resetCurrent(state, payload)`

-   Sets `state.current` to `null`

### `crudInitialState(extendState)`

Returns a state object structured to work with other helper functions. You can extend or overwrite the current state elements by passing an extended state. This function returns:

```javascript
const initialState = {
    isFetching: false,
    current: null,
    data: {},
    error: null,
    ...(extendState || {}),
};
```

### `crudReducers(extend, doneReducers) => CrudReducerInstance`

-   Generates a map of reducers for CRUD use
-   Can be extended or overwritten by passing `extend` option
-   Done reducers are created if `doneRecuders` is set to true

```javascript
const actions = crudReducers({
    // ... more reducers
}, true) // <-- creates `done` actions

const {
    setCurrent,
    resetCurrent,
    readAll, // loadingReducer
    readOne, // loadingReducer
    create, // loadingReducer
    update, // loadingReducer
    patch, // loadingReducer
    delete, // loadingReducer
    readAllSuccess,
    readOneSuccess,
    createSuccess,
    updateSuccess,
    patchSuccess
    deleteSuccess,
    readAllFail, // failReducer
    readOneFail, // failReducer
    createFail, // failReducer
    updateFail, // failReducer
    patchFail, // failReducer
    deleteFail, // failReducer
    readAllDone, // only if doneReducers is true, noop
    readOneDone, // only if doneReducers is true, noop
    createDone, // only if doneReducers is true, noop
    updateDone, // only if doneReducers is true, noop
    deleteDone, // only if doneReducers is true, noop
} = actions;
```

### `lifecycleReducers(name, reducers)`

-   Creates a map of reducers specific to an ajax request lifecycle similar to what you see in `crudReducers`, but only for 1 method call.
-   `reducers` is an optional parameter. If the reducers are not specified, it will be provided a default. The reducers are overwritten using `main` for the main action, `success` for success action, `fail` for fail action, and `done` can be a boolean or a function.

| Param            | Type                    | Required | Description                                                               | Default             |
| :--------------- | :---------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------ |
| name             | `string`                | yes      | name of action                                                            | n/a                 |
| reducers         | `object`                | no       | object of reducers                                                        | empty object        |
| reducers.main    | `function`              | no       | main reducer created from name argument as `name`                         | `loadingReducer`    |
| reducers.success | `function`              | no       | success reducer created from name argument as `nameSuccess`               | `notLoadingReducer` |
| reducers.fail    | `function`              | no       | fail reducer created from name argument as `nameFail`                     | `failReducer`       |
| reducers.done    | `function` \| `boolean` | no       | optional done reducer is boolean or reducer function create as `nameDone` | `false` or `noop`   |

Example:

```javascript
const { getTodo, getTodoSuccess, getTodoFail, getTodoDone } = lifecycleReducers(
    "getTodo",
    {
        success: (state, payload) => (state.data = payload),
        done: true,
    }
);
```

### `noop()`

-   Does nothing. Used for declaring reducers.
